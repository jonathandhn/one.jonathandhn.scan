INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

This ZIP contains the production build of the Event Scanner.
This build is pre-configured to run from the "/scan/" subdirectory.

OPTION 1: CROSS-ORIGIN (Scanner hosted separately)
--------------------------------------------------
If you host this on a different domain than your CiviCRM:
1. You must edit your CiviCRM settings to allow CORS headers.
2. Enter the domain of this scanner in "Administration > System Settings > misc".

OPTION 2: SAME-ORIGIN (Easiest / Recommended)
---------------------------------------------
If you simply drop the "scan" folder at the root of your CiviCRM server:
1. No CORS configuration is required.
2. The scanner will be accessible at: https://your-civicrm-site.org/scan/

IMPORTANT:
If you wish to host this in a folder OTHER than "/scan/", you must rebuild
the application from source with a new "base" configuration in vite.config.js.
